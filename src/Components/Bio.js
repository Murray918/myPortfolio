          For the past five years or so as a luthier I was a immersed in an field intensely tethered to detail and skill as making seemingly invasive and complex repairs that needed to have seemingly never happened or building an was an everyday journey in repairs.  On the building side there was the task of taking an attitude and a voice and matching it with a viable,  intuitive, and seemingly flawless product despite (like with almost everything) constant hangups and challenges.  This was a great training ground for Programming!

          The journey through programming came around by way of an interest in technology that was not really being utilized in the field of lutherie.  With domesticating of such technologies as 3d printing, cnc machining, and laser cutting giving birth to a whole new world makers, tinkerers, and craftsman.  I knew i wanted to move to a new and exciting field that is on the cutting edge of technology and also maybe someday get involved with some of these new revolutionizing tools.

          Many of my peers were into web development and software engineering, provided a window into their blossoming exciting careers in the world of software.  It also let me realize that the bridge missing to connect these markets and technologies is in fact software.  So here I am eager to get involved and dig deep into the world of web development.
